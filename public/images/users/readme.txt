General guidelines for user avatars

- Make sure that the image is squared, that is, the same width and height

- Crop the image to the lower size possible, but make sure it will not be 
  lower than the minimum size 380x380. You can crop the image online using 
  this tool: https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image

- Make sure the image is in JPG format. Just renaming the file extension 
  from PNG to JPG is not good because may break the image display on some
  browsers/devices. You can convert the image to JPG online using this 
  tool: https://png2jpg.com
  
- Make sure to always optimize the image to achieve a lower file size. This
  will keep the server responses fast and efficient. You can optimize the 
  image using this tool: https://tinypng.com.
  
  Optimizing the image once is generally enough, but you can reupload the
  optimized image several times to achieve higher levels of compression. If
  you compress the image several times, choose the image with less visible
  quality loss
